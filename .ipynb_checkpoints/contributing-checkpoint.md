# Contribution/expected workflow

## Start
- Generate basic ideas about the project through Zoom meetings.
- Discuss functions through Wechat/Zoom whenever all team members have time.

## Procedure
- Ceate our repository.
- After ideas about functions are finalized, split the work into two. Since both of us writing on code at the the same time will produce chaos. One will initiate the package and write all functions and tests. Another one will write code of conduct, contribution, and vignette. 
- Progress will be communicated through Wechat once update.

## End
- Final discussion will take place. A zoom meeting would be expected. Each team member will take a look at others' work. Understand and modify each others' work.
- Final correction and submission.
